## General Information
- Here US bike-sharing provider BoomBikesis a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free.Company has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues.
- The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.

## Conclusions
- when `temp` increases number of bike riders also increases ....also bike riders prefer low `windspeed` and hummidity range of `40` to `90` 
- The Seaon Spring has the lowest number of bike rider among all season in general and summer and fall see's high number of bike riders
- Month `Aug` ,`jun` and `sep` are 3 month where there are high number of bike riders
- Fitted a Linear model and got the r2 score of 0.83 and 0.82 for Test and Train data respectively
- when weather situation is `snow` then there is very low number of riders compare to other weather situations,also `clear` weather situation showing highest number of ike riders across weekdays
